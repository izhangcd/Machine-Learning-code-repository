## Diabetes Classification

A famous collection of data on whether a patient has diabetes, known as the Pima Indians dataset, and originally owned by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases can be found at Kaggle. Download this dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/kumargh/pimaindiansdiabetescsv. This data has a set of attributes of patients, and a categorical variable telling whether the patient is diabetic or not. For several attributes in this data set, a value of 0 may indicate a missing value of the variable. There are a total of 767 data-points.

Build a simple naive Bayes classifier to classify this data set. Use a normal distribution to model each of the class-conditional distributions.

Compute an estimate of the accuracy of the classifier by averaging over 10 test-train splits. Each split should randomly assign 20% of the data to test, and the rest to train.
Write this classifier and the test-train split code from scratch.  Libraries can only be used to load & hold the data.

Now adjust your code so that, for attribute 3 (Diastolic blood pressure), attribute 4 (Triceps skinfold thickness), attribute 6 (Body mass index), and attribute 8 (Age), it regards a value of 0 as a missing value when estimating the class-conditional distributions, and the posterior.
