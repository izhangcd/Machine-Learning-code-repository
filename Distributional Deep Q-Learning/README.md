*Distributional Deep Q-Learning*

Distributional RL is an interesting recent development of value based RL, where the algorithm models
the entire distribution of Q values, instead of only the expectation as in the usual Bellman equation. It
seems to lead to great empirical improvements. This is an extension to the deep RL assignment.

Objective:
***To implement the paper (the C51 algorithm) in pytorch and test it with Atari
games  Pong and show reasonable scores of average >= 15 for Pong.***

Result:
***Achieved score of around 18 for pong.***
